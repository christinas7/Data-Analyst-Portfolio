Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to view my work.

This portfolio showcases a series of projects I developed using a fictional company I created to practice SQL and data visualization techniques. The datasets are modeled after data found in a Human Resources Operations organization, with plans to expand into additional domains such as sales and finance.
The work is organized into phases, with each phase introducing new layers of data, analysis, and visualization. To complete these projects, I utilize Excel (including Power Query), MySQL, Tableau, and Power BI. All data used in these projects is completely fictional and created by me in Excel.

Each phase includes:
  1. The business question or problem being addressed
  2. Supporting documentation detailing how the data was prepared, transformed, and analyzed
  3. The visualization(s) developed to answer it

Not every dataset will include a visualization, but all will provide extracts of the MySQL code used to create and update databases, tables, and values, as well as the queries used for data extraction.

All documentation and visualizations will have an identifier with either my github handle or first name and last initial to verify authorship.

Thank you again for visiting my portfolio and taking the time to explore my work.
